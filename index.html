          Mokos was born a simple soul, a kind soul, a gentle soul.  In a world full of injustice and cruelty there was little chance he would survive.  Yet there was purpose for this bugbear in the grand scheme, a party was being formed, and from the look of it they would need his skills if they were going to survive the many ordeals to come.

          Mokos' story begins with a wise old elf named Ryul.  His mentor, teacher, and best friend.  Ryul took Mokos in when he had just escaped his clan and made him his apprentice.  However, it didnt take long for the teacher to realize his student had a very different set of skills than his own.  So rather than fit a square post into a triangular hole, Ryul formed a symbiotic relationship with the cub.  Together they discovered lost treasures and magics beyond their wildest dreams, but it wasnt long before trouble arrived.
